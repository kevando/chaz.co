We are writing a book together. All the time. We are the authors of a new story that reaches every human heart in very corner of the earth.

  content: I’d like to give book titles, but as privacy advocate I think it’s the wrong take. I think nothing says more about a person than the books that they prize because these are the ideas they embody. These are their dreams printed out. So instead, Ill say something similar. But a little different. I’m a reader. There are few things I enjoy more than having the time to go through a book. But I’m also a child of the internet. I’m part of that first generation who grew up connected. Who could reach out and see anything and this means I didn’t just read books. I read from a book that never ends. We are writing a book together. All the time. All of these different communities. We are the authors of a new story that reaches every human heart in very corner of the earth.
