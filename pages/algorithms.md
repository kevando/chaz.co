No one likes to admit how much we rely on algorithms.

Most of your song recommendations came from an algorithm. Those videothumbnails next to the video you're watching were selected by an algorithm. The cars that drive themselves? Algorithms. So what is in an algorithm?

Spotify and Youtube algoirthms recommend content based on what they know about you. Spotify knows which songs you listen to and Youtube has access to your gmail. The result is some pretty great recommendations. Spotify produces individualized that include real time listening data. [1] Youtube plays mostly videos they recommended.  70% of views on Youtube come from clicks on the side bar.[2]

The way sites achieve this addiction level engagement come from Nir Eyal. To understand how it works, read his book Hooked where he lays out the simple 4 step process that all sites use. To understand why this is such a problem, read his second book Indistractsble where he explains how to pull away from sites that employed the methods from his first book. Its comical.

I try to combat all this by controlling my feed as much as possible. I use Youtube's "watch later" feature to create a consistent stream of great videos without prejiduce for where it came. I gave up on Spotify and I use Hypmachine to discover songs from someone other than a robot.

Ever since [move 37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNrXgpSEEIE), it's more important than ever. This showed me that AI is more than just following orders, it has the ability to create in ways I did not think possible.Empathy abundence creates conflict scarcity
