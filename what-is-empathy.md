# **Empathy**

The best way to understand something is to approach it from many different angles. Since empathy is all about understanding, let's find as many approaches as we can.

# ðŸ“–

Let's start by looking at the dictionary definition of **empathy.**

`One's capacity to understand  another person.`

Let's keep going and look at the definition of **capacity**

`the maximum amount of something.`

and let's make sure we understand **understanding**

`the ability to comprehend. `

We now have the building blocks to figure out what it takes to make empathy.

# ðŸ¥ª

Capacity is your willingness. Understanding = Imagination + Listening`

# ðŸŒ§

#### Bucket Analogy

Imagine yourself holding a bucket trying to catch rain where water is empathy. *Maximizing* the amount of water you collect depends on:

1. The size of your bucket.
2. Holding where the most water drips.

You could have the biggest bucket in the world, but if you don't stand next to the gutter it won't help much. And standing next to the gutter is no good with a tiny little baby bucket.

Empathy works the same way.

## Examples

### Capacity, but no understanding

You could be super willing (huge bucket) to understand Stephen Hawking, but he lives in a wheel chair and can't speak. It's probably really hard to understand that experience. And that's ok. **Even though you can't understand, Stephen will appreciate your willingness.**

### Understanding, but no capacity

You could easily understand (standing under the gutter) the reason someone left a nasty comment on the internet is because they hate themselves, but if you aren't willing to understand, there's not much empathy.

#### Capacity and Understanding

You could understand that someone with racist parents might have racist tendancies. That doesn't mean you support their racist tendancies.

> Empathy does not require agreement.

#### **More math**

`Understanding = Imagination + Listening`

It's hard to imagine someone else's experience if you haven't shared a similar experience.
